      - I would like to work for Petto Farm because I love organic food, but I am
        stuck here, typing endlessly about stocks
      - Yeah maybe this is indeed a cult, but at least we eat good at this farm yeah?
    eatDialogues:
      dialogues:
      - I would give you some of my AMAZING bio salad, but it would be too much for
        you to handle all this organic wonder
      - Yeah, farming is good! But eating farm product is better ooooh yes you know
        me!!!
    toiletDialogues:
      dialogues:
      - "I must eat healthy food and organic fibers so that my.. you know what\u2026
        doesn\u2019t come out like that. I swear will"
      - Potty time is much better with organic things in my belly
    socialDialogues:
      dialogues:
      - "Okay, maybe old McToe Nails\u2019 farm was indeed stolen by Petto, but it\u2019s
        so much organic and healthy now!"
      - Did you know you could join the Petto Farm to get 50% off of tomatoes???
        Cool deal right?

      - "I saw in a work email sent to the boss in which that nasty man, Esptin,
        had co-owned Petto Farm. What a creepy world hmm\u2026"
      - Petto is the bane of my existence...
    eatDialogues:

      - '*spits* Eww what the flip *looks at organic taco in hand*'
      - This is kind of disgusting man *throws "bio" thing away*
    toiletDialogues:
      dialogues:
      - Nope. No more organic or bionic food for me. Just shat a government controlled
        smart chip
      - This bio thingy is not for me *poops themself to sleep*
    socialDialogues:
      dialogues:
      - "In all fairness, Petto Farm should give the farm back to McToe Nails! It\u2019s
        not even organic anymore even though it\u2019s a literal farm"
      - The bio farm is really up to no good!!! It moved on that weird saint something
        island... It's up to no good
